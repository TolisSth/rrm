# RRM 
rrm or else Rust ReMove is a clone of the famous GNU coreutil rm written in the Rust programming language. 

# How to use
Use it just like you would use rm. The only difference is that rrm does need the flag `-r` to remove directories, it automatically removes them. For more information use `rrm -h`. 

# Motivation for this project 
I am currently in the process of learning the Rust programming language and I thought that it would be a good idea to introduce the element of antagonism in this process, that's why I contacted a software engineer friend of mine and started a small "program jam" to clone the rm utility in Rust. This project was developed in 3 hours + 3 hours of studying, expect to see updates on this project as I develop my knowledge in Rust. 

# Requirements 
Since all the dependencies that I used in this version are part of the Rust standard library, currently there are *NO* requirements. Ofcourse that is subject to change. 

# Disclaimer
Please do not use this a replacement for `rm`, this a very unstable program and it might cause damage if used without caution.
